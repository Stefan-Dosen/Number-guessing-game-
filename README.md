# Number Guessing Game

A simple Python command-line game where you try to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100.

## How to Play

1. Run the script.
2. Choose a difficulty level:
   - Easy (10 guesses)
   - Medium (5 guesses)
   - Hard (3 guesses)
3. Try to guess the number within the allowed attempts.
4. After each guess, you'll get a hint if the number is higher or lower.
5. Win if you guess correctly, or lose if you run out of guesses.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+ (for `match` statement support)
